# NBA-MVP-Predictions
Group project on deciding the NBA MVP for the 2021 season using a variety of machine learning techniques including Linear Regression, Regression Trees, Regression Forests, Bagging and Boosting, we can now address the question of which player truly is the MVP of the league.

This group project was done by Brendan Zimmer, Anuj Amin and Sam Murray.  Using real world data we were able to find a final answer which can be found in the FinalReport.

All the code for the project including the visuals can be found in the newanalysis.ipynb
